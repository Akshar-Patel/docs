# Super

<!-- TODO: Add Pop! key when that starts shipping -->

Super is the OS key on your keyboard; if you're using a System76 computer, it 
will be the Ubuntu logo. On a computer that came with Windows, it's the Windows
key. On a Mac, it's the Command key.

In Pop!_OS, it's the key that handles the majority of OS and window actions.

Tapping it on its own brings up the Activities overview, which is the core way
of launching apps and managing your workflow.

Super + Up/Down change workspaces, Ctrl + Super + Left/Right tiles windows to 
the left and right of your display, and Super + Tab quickly switches between
your open windows.

Here's an exhaustive list of every Super shortcut for reference:
